Horse64 Programming Language
============================

**Horse64** is a high-level language that combines readability, clean dynamic
typing, and readiness for large projects. **It's more grounded rethinking
of Python.** Get it for [free](https://horse64.org/get).

```Horse64
func main {
    print("Hello from Horse64!")
}
```

### Useful starting points

- [Check project news](https://horse64.org/#news).

- [Documentation](https://horse64.org/docs/Welcome).

- [Get the 📦 SDK](https://horse64.org/download).

- [Project license](https://codeberg.org/Horse64/core.horse64.org/src/branch/main/LICENSE.md).

This repository holds the code of the standard library, compiler,
and main documentation. The code is officially hosted on [Codeberg](
https://codeberg.org/Horse64/core.horse64.org) with a GitHub mirror.


Install & Build
---------------

The recommended way to install is [to get the prebuilt SDK](
https://horse64.org/get), and then to use [horp](https://codeberg.org/Horse64/core.horse64.org/src/branch/main/docs/Runtime.md#horp) to update or switch versions. (All
base tools including *horp* are shipped with the SDK.)

Where Is What?
--------------

If you want to contribute or report a bug, you'll find
the Horse64 ecosystem is made of a larger bunch
of projects. Due to that, **locating where each
component is** and where the code is, can occasionally
be challenging. Therefore, there's a
[handy resource list for finding projects and
code locations](https://codeberg.org/Horse64/core.horse64.org/src/branch/main/docs/Resources.md) to help you out.
