Features
========

Here's cool stuff Horse64 can do:


Concurrency
-----------

Use effortlessly **[concurrent](
/docs/Concurrency) networking** and disk I/O:

```Horse64
import net.fetch from core.horse64.org

func download_my_page {  # This won't block your entire program!
    var main_page = net.fetch.get_str("https://horse64.org")
    later:

    await main_page
    print("Downloaded web page: " + main_page)
}
```

This helps with designing programs that are scalable and
can handle many remote resources at once without freezing.


Batteries included
------------------

The standard library offers many features,
like an **`.ini` config parser** or a **JSON parser**:

```Horse64
import confparse from core.horse64.org

func check_config {
    # Read an ini file:
    var contents = confparse.parse_from_file("myconf.ini")
    print(contents["mysection"]["myvalue"])

    # ...or read it from the web?
    var remote_contents = confparse.parse_from_uri(
        "https://example.com/conf.ini"
    ) later:

    await remote_contents
    print("Got remote config!")
}
```


Comparison with other languages and use cases
---------------------------------------------

Horse64 is a dynamically typed, high-level language. Here is
how it compares to the other programming languages
[Python](https://python.org),
[JavaScript (JS)](https://www.javascript.com/),
[Go](https://go.dev/), and
[C++](https://cplusplus.com/). *Disclaimer: the
following lists are subjective and all languages are subject to
change, **no guarantee provided for accuracy or fitness
for any particular purpose** of these lists at all.*

What Horse64 is good at
-----------------------

This is what Horse64 is intended to be suited for:

- Helping beginners and contributors **get started
  ðŸš€ quickly** while still suitable for larger projects.

- Desktop **apps are shipped ðŸ“¦ mostly self-contained** by default.

- Creation and maintenance of **server backends using the ðŸ“¶ integrated networking.**

- [Concurrency out-of-the-box](/docs/concurrency) supports
  **ðŸ“± responsive, non-blocking behavior.**


What Horse64 is bad at
----------------------

This is what Horse64 is likely to be bad at:

- ðŸš« Extreme raw speed, since it uses a bytecode VM.

- ðŸš« Complex offline code type checking, since it's dynamically typed.
  *(The compiler will however catch more basics beyond many other
  scripting languages.)*

- ðŸš« Maximum fast compiler, since that's not a project focus.

- ðŸš« Heavily functional programming, since Horse64 is more focused on
  clean in-order imperative code and object-oriented code.
