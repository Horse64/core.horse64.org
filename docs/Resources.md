Resources
=========

This section has various external resources useful when using the
[Horse64 programming language](https://horse64.org). This
includes the code location for all the core tooling, where
to report bugs, etc.


SDK
---

If you want to get started, [**go here for
the SDK** (Software Development Kit) for Horse64](
https://horse64.org/download
).


Report bugs
-----------

Before you report a bug, you might want to check the
[standard library reference documentation](
./docs/FIXME)
and the [ðŸ’¬ community chat](https://horse64.org/chat)
to verify if what you found is truly a bug or rather
a misunderstanding.

To report bugs, here are the locations for core components:

- [Compiler bug reports](
  https://codeberg.org/Horse64/core.horse64.org/issues).

- [Standard library bug reports](
  https://codeberg.org/Horse64/core.horse64.org/issues).

- [Horp (package manager) bug reports](
  https://codeberg.org/Horse64/horp.horse64.org/issues).

- [HVM (C runtime) bug reports](
  https://codeberg.org/Horse64/hvm.horse64.org/issues).


Documentation
-------------

If you're reading this, you found the documentation! If you got
some offline copy, [switch to the latest online copy of the
documentation](https://horse64.org/docs/Welcome).


License
-------

**The licenses for all core projects are almost the
same,** but feel free to check the license for each one
yourself.

The license files can be found in the respective code
repository, where the code is located. This is listed
for each sub project in this file, e.g. [go here for
the standard library source code](#standard-library).
Then, browse to the `LICENSE.md` file inside the code,
right at the top level.

[For example, here's core.horse64.org's `LICENSE.md`
file.](
https://codeberg.org/Horse64/core.horse64.org/src/branch/main/LICENSE.md).

Standard library
----------------

The standard library providing all the built-in functionality in
the `core.horse64.org` can be found in the same location as
[horsec](#Horsec).

- Get it by fetching the **SDK**.

- Find the [ðŸ§¬ standard library code here](
  https://codeberg.org/Horse64/core.horse64.org/src/branch/main/src).


Horp
----

The **Hor**se **p**ackage manager, [see code here](
https://codeberg.org/Horse64/horp.horse64.org/).


Horsec
------

The official compiler for Horse64 code is a binary called `horsec`.
It's written primarily in Horse64.

- [The compilation section describes some details on horsec](
  /docs/Compilation.md).

- Get it by fetching the **SDK**.

- Find [ðŸ§¬ horsec's code here](
  https://codeberg.org/Horse64/core.horse64.org/src/branch/main/src/compiler/)
  along with the other parts of the standard library.


HVM
---

HVM, the "Horse Virtual Machine", provides the
runtime powering Horse64 programs.
HVM is primarily written in [C](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29).

- Get it by fetching the **SDK**.

- Find the [ðŸ§¬ HVM source code here](
  https://codeberg.org/Horse64/hvm.horse64.org/src/branch/main/src/
  ).

- Read here on [advanced technical runtime concerns](
  /docs/Runtime%20Concerns.md).


Spew3D
------

**Spew3D** is the base library used for accessing operating system
facilities, multimedia, and other base functionality, used
by [HVM](#hvm). [ðŸ§¬ Find its code here](
https://codeberg.org/Spew3D/Spew3D).
While it can be used separately for any [C program](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29),
it's maintained as part of the Horse64 project.
