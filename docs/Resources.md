Resources
=========

This section has various external resources useful when using the
[Horse64 programming language](https://horse64.org).


SDK
---

If you want to get started, [**click here for
the SDK** (Software Development Kit) for Horse64](
https://horse64.org/download
).

Documentation
-------------

If you're reading this, you found the documentation! If you got
some offline copy, [switch to the latest dpocumentation
online copy](https://horse64.org/docs/Welcome).


Standard library
----------------

The standard library providing all the built-in functionality in
the `core.horse64.org` can be found in the same location as
[horsec](#Horsec).

- Get it by fetching the **SDK**.

- Find the [standard library code here](
  https://codeberg.org/Horse64/core.horse64.org/src/branch/main/src).


Horsec
------

The official compiler for Horse64 code is a binary called `horsec`.
It's written primarily in Horse64.

- Get it by fetching the **SDK**.

- Find [horsec's code here](
  https://codeberg.org/Horse/core.horse64.org)
  along with the other parts of the standard library.



HVM
---

HVM, the "Horse Virtual Machine", provides the
runtime powering Horse64 programs.
HVM is primarily written in [C](
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29).

- Get it by fetching the **SDK**.

- Find the [HVM source code here](
  https://codeberg.org/Horse64/core.horse64.org/src/branch/main/src/compiler
  ).

- Read here on [advanced technical runtime concerns](
  /docs/Runtime%20Concerns.md).
